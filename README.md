# Basic Keydown Playground

Just a tiny practice project to brush up my JS event listener basics. Nothing fancy: press any key and the page shows it; hit space and it prints "SPACE" instead of leaving a blank.

## What this is
- A single dark page with one big `h1`.
- `script.js` adds a `keydown` listener on `window` and mirrors the pressed key into the heading.
- Space bar gets a small edge-case so it shows text instead of an empty string.

## How to run
1. Download/clone the folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. (No build steps, no npm.)
3. Press keys and watch the heading update.

## Notes / Future tweaks
- Kept everything minimal with inline CSS/JS for now.
- Might add a quick animation (color flash or scale) if I revisit.
- Virtual keyboards on mobile are less fun; this is mainly for desktop.

That’s it. Casual practice project to keep the muscle memory fresh. :)
